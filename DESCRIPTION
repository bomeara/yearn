Package: yearn
Title: Attaching and if needed installing packages
Version: 0.0.1

Description: You should ideally have all the packages you require for work and call them with library() or require(). However, especially in teaching, there can be a lot of hiccups: not everyone has the packages installed, they may have the case wrong, some packages might be on github, not CRAN, etc. This package explicitly allows sloppiness: it will try to find the best package that matches what you're yearning for.
Depends: R (>= 3.3.0)
