Description: This tries to attach a package if you have it; if not, it tries to install it from BioConductor or CRAN; if not available there, it tries to install it from the cran mirror on GitHub, which includes packages that have been removed from CRAN; if not available there, it looks for a matching other package on GitHub to install. Note this is sloppy practice and prone to all sorts of risks. However, there are use cases, such as quick scripting, or in a class where students already know best practices, where this can be useful. yearn was inspired by teaching in PhyloMeth, a course funded by an NSF CAREER award to the author (NSF DEB-1453424).
